# Introduction

Markdown is one of the famous [markup languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) widely used by developers, bloggers, messaging services etc. Due to its dead-easy syntax and possiblity to implement multiple plugins like [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/), recently it gained much attention in the academic writing. Markdown syntax is not standarized universaly. So, depending upon the platform, the syntax may slightly vary - and could have additional features. One good example is capability of using latex symbols and math functions inside markdown supported by [R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [Github flavoured markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) syntaxes. There were multitude of cheatsheets and tutorials available on markdown. But this guide focus more on their applicability towards scientific writing. The guide is configured as follows:

1. [Basic Syntax](basics.md)
2. [Rendring output](render.md)
3. [Standard tools](tools.md)
4. [Other tweaks](tweaks.md)
